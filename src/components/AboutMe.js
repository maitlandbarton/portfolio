            My name is Mattie Barton. I'm a Fullstack Web Developer–focus on
            Frontend–with a solid foundation in React and Node.js.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been working in the tech start-up scene in Berlin for 3
            years, primarily as a Client Success Manager. My previous experience
            as a Client Success Manager has provided me with valuable insights
            into customer needs and a strong foundation in communication and
            project management, and I am excited to bring this holistic view
            into an engineering role.
          </p>

          <p>
            I thrive in an agile, collaborative environment where continuous
            learning is paramount.
